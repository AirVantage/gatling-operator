The Gatling Operator User Guide introduce how to configure and deploy Gatling load testing and lifecycle of a distributed Gatling load testing.

For the installation of Gatling Operator, please check [Quick Start Guide](quickstart-guide.md).

## Configuration Overview

Here are 2 major configurations you would make as a Gatling operator user:

- Gatling load testing
  - Gatling load testing runs in Gatling runner container which is created as a part of the lifecycle of distributed Gatling load testing. It involves Gatling load testing related files as well as Gatling base docker image. Please check [Gatling Load Testing Configuration and Deployment](#gatling-load-testing-configuration-and-deployment) for the details.
- Lifecycle of a distributed Gatling load testing
  - You define the desired state of a distributed Gatling load testing in `Gatling CR`, based on which Gatling Controller manages a lifecycle of the distributed Gatling load testing. Please check [Gatling Custom Resource Examples](#gatling-custom-resource-examples) for the details.

## Gatling Load Testing Configuration and Deployment

As described in Configuration Overview, there are 2 things that you need to consider in configuring Gatling load testing:

- `Gatling docker image` that includes Java Runtime and Gatling standalone bundle package at minimum
- `Gatling load testing related files` such as Gatling scenario (simulation), external resources, Gatling runtime configuration files, etc.

For `Gatling docker image`, you can use default image `ghcr.io/st-tech/gatling:latest`, or you can create custom image to use.

For `Gatling load testing related files`, you have 2 options:

- Create custom image to bundle Gatling load testing files with Java runtime and Gatling standalone bundle package
- Add Gatling load testing files as multi-line definitions in `.spec.testScenatioSpec` part of `Gatling CR`

### Create Custom Gatling Image to bundle Gatling Load Testing Files

As explained previously, you can use a default image `ghcr.io/st-tech/gatling:latest`.

Here are files included in the default Gatling docker image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/st-tech/gatling-operator.git
cd gatling-operator
tree gatling

gatling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile                        # Default Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conf
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatling.conf                  # Default Gatling runtime configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logback.xml                   # Default logback configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myresources.csv           # Default external resource file
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ simulations
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyBasicSimulation.scala   # Default simulation file (MyBasicSimulation)
```

Suppose that you want to customize Gatling docker image by adding new simulation file (`YourSimulation.scala`) and its relevant external resource file (`yourresources.csv`), you can do like this:

```bash
# Add your simulation file
add YourSimulation.scala gatling/user-files/simulations
# Add your external resource file
add yourresources.csv gatling/user-files/resources

# Build Docker image
cd gatling
docker build -t <your-registry>/gatling:<tag> .
# Push the image to your container registry
docker push <your-registry>/gatling:<tag>
```
üìù Ensure that you're logged into your docker container registry

Alternatively you can build and push the Gatling image by using `make` commands:

```bash
# Build Docker image
make sample-docker-build SAMPLE_IMG=<your-registry>/gatling:<tag>
# Push the image to your container registry
make sample-docker-push SAMPLE_IMG=<your-registry>/gatling:<tag>
```

üìù You can see all pre-defined commands by executing `make help` or just checking [Makefile](https://github.com/st-tech/gatling-operator/blob/main/Makefile)

After the image is pushed to the registry, you can run the image like this to see how it works:

```bash
docker run -it "<your-registry>/gatling:<tag>" 
```

Finally, specify the image in `.spec.podSpec.gatlingImage` of Gatling CR to use it in your distributed load testing.

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample01
spec:
  podSpec:
    serviceAccountName: "gatling-operator-worker"
    gatlingImage: <your-registry>/gatling:<tag>
...omit...
```

### Add Gatling Load Testing Files in Gatling CR

As explained previously, instead of bundling Gatling load testing files in the Gatling docker image, you can add them as multi-line definitions in `.spec.testScenatioSpec` of `Gatling CR`, based on which Gatling Controller automatically creates `ConfigMap` resources and injects Gatling runner Pod with the files.

You can add a Gatling simulation file (scala), an external resource file, and gatling runtime config file (gatling.conf) respectively in `.spec.testScenarioSpec.simulationData`, `.spec.testScenarioSpec.resourceData`, and `.spec.testScenarioSpec.gatlingConf` like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample
spec:
  testScenarioSpec:
    simulationData:
      MyBasicSimulation.scala: |
        # Add Gatling simulation file (scala) as multi-line
    resourceData:
      sample.csv: |
        # Add external resource file as multi-line 
    gatlingConf:
      gatling.conf: |
        # Add gatling.conf as multi-line
```

For a full sample manifest, please check [this](../config/samples/gatling-operator_v1alpha1_gatling02.yaml).

üìù **Caution**: Please be noted that the data stored in a ConfigMap cannot exceed 1 MiB (ref [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)). If you need to store files that are larger than this limit, you may want to consider create Custom Gatling Image to bundle them in the container.

### Debug and Trace Gatling Load Testing

As you can see in the section of [Create Custom Gatling Image to bundle Gatling Load Testing Files](#create-custom-gatling-image-to-bundle-gatling-load-testing-files), you can check the logging output of each Gatling load testing via container log. But if you want to know more details on what's going on in Gatling load testing, you can leverage `logback.xml`.
You can debug Gatling with `logback.xml` which is supposed to be located in the Gatling conf directory (see [gatling/conf/logback.xml](https://github.com/st-tech/gatling-operator/blob/main/gatling/conf/logback.xml)).

For example, here is default logback configuration which allows to print debuggin information to the console.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

	<appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
		<encoder>
			<pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%-5level] %logger{15} - %msg%n%rEx</pattern>
		</encoder>
		<immediateFlush>false</immediateFlush>
	</appender>

	<root level="WARN">
		<appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />
	</root>

</configuration>
```

You add the following tag in order to log all HTTP requests and responses.

```xml
<logger name="io.gatling.http.engine.response" level="TRACE" />
```
To know more on logback configuration in Gatling, please check [the Gatling official guide](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/guides/debugging/).

Once you finish updating `logback.xml`, you rebuild the Gatling image and push it to your registry, so you can use the image in your Gatling load testing.
## Gatling Custom Resource Examples

You can configure the various features and parameters of the distributed Gatling load testing using Gatling CR.

Gatling CR largely defines the following five:

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample
spec:

  ## (1) Flags for execution phases
  generateReport: true
  notifyReport: true
  cleanupAfterJobDone: true

  ## (2) Spec for Gatling Runner Pod
  podSpec:
  ## (3) Spec for Cloud Storage Provider to store Gatling reports
  cloudStorageSpec:
  ## (4) Spec for Notification Service Provider to notify Gatling load testing result 
  notificationServiceSpec:
  ## (5) Spec for Gatling load testing scenario and how it's executed
  testScenarioSpec:
```

Please check the rest of the section and [Gatling CRD Reference](../docs/api.md) for more details on the Gatling CR configuration.

### Choose Execution Phases

You can choose if each of the following phases in distributed Gatling load testing to execute by setting their relevant flags:

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample
spec:
  generateReport: true
  generateLocalReport: true
  notifyReport: true
  cleanupAfterJobDone: true
```

- `.spec.generateReport`: It's an optional flag of generating an aggregated gatling report and defaults to false. You must configure `.spec.cloudStorageSpec` as well if the flag is set to true.
- `.spec.generateLocalReport`: It's an optional flag of generating gatling report at each Pod and defaults to false.
- `.spec.notifyReport`: It's an optional flag of notifying gatling report and defaults to false. You must configure `.spec.notificationServiceSpec` as well if the flag is set to true.
- `.spec.cleanupAfterJobDone`: It's an optional flag of cleanup gatling resources after the job done and defaults to false. Please set the flag to true if you want to dig into logs of each Pod even after the job done.

### Configure Gatling Runner Pod

You can configure various attributions of Gatling runner Pod in `.spec.podSpec`.

#### Resource Allocation and Scheduling for Gatling Runner Pod

You can set CPU and RAM resource allocation for the Pod. Also you can set affinity (such as Node affinity) and tolerations to be used by the scheduler to decide where the Pod can be placed in the cluster like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample01
spec:
  podSpec:
    serviceAccountName: gatling-operator-worker
    gatlingImage: ghcr.io/st-tech/gatling:latest
    rcloneImage: rclone/rclone
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "500Mi"
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
                - key: kubernetes.io/os
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - linux
    tolerations:
      - key: "node-type"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "non-kube-system"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

You also can set container images for Gatling load testing and rclone respectively in `.spec.podSpec.gatlingImage` and `.spec.podSpec.rcloneImage`.

- `.spec.podSpec.gatlingImage`: It's an optional field for Gatling load testing container image and defaults to `ghcr.io/st-tech/gatling:latest`. You can add your custom image here.
- `.spec.podSpec.rcloneImage`: It's an optional field for [rclone](https://rclone.org/) container image and defaults to `rclone/rclone:latest`. The rclone is used for uploading Gatling report files to and downloading them from Cloud Storages. You can add your custom image here.

#### Service Account for Gatling Runner Pod

You must set service account for the Pod in `.spec.serviceAccountName` and configure its permission as it's neccessary for the Gatling runner Pod (actually `gatling-waiter` container in the Pod) to adjust the timing of load testing start.

Suppose you want to set a service account named `gatling-operator-worker` in `.spec.serviceAccountName` like the example above and deploy the Gatling CR into the default namespace (`default`), you must apply the following permissions into the same namespace (`default`).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: gatling-operator-worker
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "patch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: gatling-operator-worker
    apiGroup: ""
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: ""
```

Please check an [example manifest for service account permissions](../config/samples/gatling-worker-service-account.yaml) too.

### Configure Gatling Load Testing Scenario and How It's Executed

You can configure Gatling load testing scenario and how it's executed in `.spec.testScenatioSpec`.

#### Start Time of Gatling Load Testing

In `.spec.testScenarioSpec.startTime` you can set start time for Gatling load testing to start running. You're supposed to set the time in UTC and in a format of `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`.

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample
spec:
  testScenarioSpec:
    startTime: 2022-01-01 12:00:00
```

#### Parallel Number of Gatling Load Testing

You can set parallel number of Gatling load testing in `.spec.testScenarioSpec.parallelism`. The Gatling Controller use the value to set the parallelism of Gatling Runner Job.

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample
spec:
  testScenarioSpec:
    parallelism: 4
```

### Configure Cloud Storage Provider

In `.spec.cloudStorageSpec` you can configure Cloud Storage Provider for storing Gatling reports. Here are main fields to set in `.spec.cloudStorageSpec`:

- `.spec.cloudStorageSpec.provider`: It's a required field for the cloud storage provider to use. Supported value on the field are either `aws` (for [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)) or `gcp` (for [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/products/storage)).
- `.spec.cloudStorageSpec.bucket`: It's a required field for the name of storage bucket.
- `.spec.cloudStorageSpec.region`: It's an optional field for the name of region that the cloud storage belong to.

#### Set Amazon S3 as Cloud Storage

Suppose that you want to store Gatling reports to a bucket named `gatling-operator-reports` of Amazon S3 located in `ap-northeast-1` region, you configure each fields in `.spec.cloudStorageSpec` like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample
spec:
  cloudStorageSpec:
    provider: "aws"
    bucket: "gatling-operator-reports"
    region: "ap-northeast-1"
```

However, this is not enough. You must supply Gatling Pod (both Gatling Runner Pod and Gatling Reporter Pod) with AWS credentials to access Amazon S3. Strictly speaking, [rclone](https://rclone.org/) container in Gatling Pod interacts with Amazon S3, thus you need to supply rclone with AWS credentials.

There are multiple authentication methods that can be tried.

(1) Setting the following environment variables for Gatling Pod

- Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
- Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`

```yaml
  cloudStorageSpec:
    provider: "aws"
    bucket: "gatling-operator-reports"
    region: "ap-northeast-1"
    env:
      - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        value: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: aws-credentail-secrets
            key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

(2) Attaching an IAM role to Node Group on which EKS Pod runs or a Kubernetes service account that is attached to EKS Pod (This is only for AWS)

Here is an IAM policy to attach for Gatling Pod to interact with Amazon S3 bucket:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- Replace `BUCKET_NAME` above with your bucket name
- To know more about the ways to supply rclone with a set of AWS credentials, please check [this](https://rclone.org/s3/#configuration).

#### Set Google Cloud Storage as Cloud Storage

TBU

### Configure Notification Service Provider

In `.spec.notificationServiceSpec` you can configure Notification Service Provider to which you post webhook message in order to notify Gatling load testing result. Here are main fields to set in `.spec.notificationServiceSpec`.

- `.spec.notificationServiceSpec.provider`: It's a required field for the notification service provider to use. Supported value on the field is currently `slack` (for [Slack](https://slack.com/)) only.
- `.spec.cloudStorageSpec.secretName`: It's a required field for the name of Kubernetes Secret that contains all key/value sets needed for posting webhook message to the provider.

#### Set Slack as Notification Service

Suppose that you want to notify Gatling load testing result via Slack and you store credentail info (Slack webhook URL) in Kubernetes Secret named `gatling-notification-slack-secrets`, you configure each fields in `.spec.notificationServiceSpec` like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: gatling-operator.tech.zozo.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gatling
metadata:
  name: gatling-sample
spec:
  notificationServiceSpec:
    provider: "slack"
    secretName: "gatling-notification-slack-secrets"
```

In the Secret you need to set Slack webhook URL value (in base64 encoded string) for a Slack channel to which you want to deliver the message. The key name for the Slack webhook URL must be `incoming-webhook-url`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  incoming-webhook-url: <base64 encoded Webhook-URL string>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: gatling-notification-slack-secrets
type: Opaque
```
Please check an [example manifest for the Secret](https://github.com/st-tech/gatling-operator/blob/main/config/samples/gatling-notification-slack-secrets.yaml) too.
